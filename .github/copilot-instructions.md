## Angular Development Patterns

### Component Architecture

- Use standalone components (default behavior, do NOT set `standalone: true`)
- Prefer `input()` and `output()` functions over decorators
- Use signals for reactive state management with `computed()` for derived state
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` for all components
- Use `inject()` function instead of constructor injection
- Implement lazy loading for feature routes
- Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of structural directives

### Component Structure Example

```typescript

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
  host: {
    // Use host object instead of @HostBinding/@HostListener
  }
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  // Use input() and output() functions
  data = input.required<EntityType>();
  change = output<EntityType>();

  // Use inject() for dependencies
  private entityService = inject(EntityService);

  // Use signals for reactive state
  filteredData = computed(() =>
    this.data().filter(item => item.isActive)
  );
}
```

### Component Guidelines

- Keep components small and focused on single responsibility
- Prefer inline templates for small components
- Prefer Reactive forms over Template-driven forms
- Use class bindings instead of `ngClass`
- Use style bindings instead of `ngStyle`
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for static images (not base64)

### Template Best Practices

- Keep templates simple, avoid complex logic
- Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`
- Use async pipe for observables

### Service Patterns

- Use `providedIn: 'root'` for singleton services
- Design services around single responsibility
- Use the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use dependency injection for testability

### State Management

- Use signals for local component state
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Keep state transformations pure and predictable
- Do NOT use `mutate` on signals, use `update` or `set` instead

### Host Bindings

- Do NOT use the `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener` decorators
- Put host bindings inside the `host` object of the `@Component` or `@Directive` decorator instead

## TypeScript Development Standards

### Type Safety

- Use strict type checking (already configured)
- Prefer type inference when obvious
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` when type is uncertain
- Use proper generics for entity types
- Implement proper error handling with typed exceptions

### Code Quality

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Prefer inline templates for small components
- Write maintainable, performant, and accessible code
- Use _ESLint_ for linting (`npm run lint`)
- Use _prettier_ for code formatting
- Maintain a comprehensive test suite with Karma and Playwright

## Aam Digital specific patterns

### Entity Architecture

- All data models extend the base `Entity` class
- Use entity schemas for configuration-driven field definitions
- Define entity schemas through `@DatabaseField()` annotations in the model classes
- Implement proper permissions checking via CASL integration.
  Components and buttons can use `EntityAbility` and `DisableEntityOperationDirective` to check and enforce permissions.
- Follow entity lifecycle patterns for CRUD operations
- Use entity services for data access and caching
- Implement specific datatypes (Date, ConfigurableEnum, etc.) extending the `DefaultDatatype` class. Implement "edit" and "display" components for a datatype's customized UI.

### Configuration System

The platform is highly configurable through JSON configuration files, allowing customization without code changes. This includes:
- Entity definitions and field configurations
- Dashboard layouts and widgets
- Navigation menus and views
- Reports and data exports

When developing new functionality:
- Leverage the existing config-driven architecture
- Use the established configuration patterns for new features
- Create interfaces for configuration objects and let component classes implement them
- Validate configurations properly

### Project & File Structure
- `src/app/core/` - Core system modules and services
  - Shared components go in `src/app/core/common-components/`
- `src/app/features/` - Feature-specific modules
- `e2e/` - End-to-end tests with Playwright
- `doc/` - Documentation and API reference
- `build/` - Build configuration and scripts
- Follow the existing module structure with entity-based organization

## UX and Styling
- Use Angular Material components for UI consistency
- Follow Material Design guidelines
- Use SCSS for styling
  - Use global variables and mixins from `src/styles/` for colors (e.g. `@use "variables/colors";` and `colors.$primary`)
- Use global style classes from the files in the `src/styles/globals/` folder (e.g. `flex-row` and `margin-regular`) where possible,
  instead of creating new custom styles
- If custom styles are necessary, create a class with a meaningful name in the component-specific scss file and avoid inline styles


## Internationalization (i18n)

- All user-facing strings must be translatable
- Use Angular i18n markers or `$localize` for strings
- Follow existing translation key patterns

## Performance & Accessibility

- Implement OnPush change detection strategy
- Use trackBy functions for lists
- Follow WCAG guidelines for accessibility
- Optimize bundle size with lazy loading
- Use Angular Material accessibility features

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Testing (Jasmine/Karma)

- Write unit tests for all new components and services
- Mock dependencies properly using Angular testing utilities
- Test entity operations with proper data setup/teardown
- Use established testing patterns from the project

### End-to-End Testing (Playwright)

- Follow Playwright patterns in `e2e/tests/`
- Use realistic user scenarios
- Test critical user flows and accessibility

### Demo Data & Development

- Provide demo data generators for new entities
- Use `@faker-js/faker` for realistic test data
- Follow existing demo data patterns in `core/demo-data/`

## GitHub Copilot-Specific Guidelines

### When generating code:

1. Follow the established Angular patterns and TypeScript standards
2. Use the entity system patterns for data operations
3. Generate appropriate unit tests alongside components
4. Include proper i18n or $localize markers for user-facing strings

### When suggesting solutions:

- Consider the offline-first architecture
- Leverage existing entity services and configurations
- Suggest Angular Material components when appropriate
- Include accessibility considerations
- Follow the established testing patterns

### For Ask mode queries:

- Reference existing patterns from the codebase
- Explain how solutions fit into the entity system
- Consider configuration-driven approaches

### For Agent mode implementations:

- Create complete, production-ready code
- Include proper error handling and logging
- Generate demo data when creating new entities
- Follow the established file organization
- Generate or adapt unit tests
- If similar changes are required in multiple places, only implement in one place and ask for review before implementing elsewhere
- If a change is complex or large, first suggest and approach broken into smaller parts and ask for review after each part
- If unsure about a specific implementation detail, ask for clarification before proceeding
- Do not change any code or tests that are unrelated to the direct task
- Check the "Problems" tab in VSCode for TypeScript errors and any other issues after making changes before running tests
- Remove unused typescript imports
- Check terminal output and fix unused Angular component imports or other warnings
- When all changes are done, ask the user if the task should be finalized.
  After confirmation, run tests (`npm run test`) and linting (`npm run lint`) and fix any issues.

## Common Commands

- `npm run start` - Development server
- `npm run test` - Unit tests
- `npm run e2e` - End-to-end tests
- `npm run lint` - Linting
- `npm run build` - Production build

to run tests in Agent Mode, use the `#runTests` tool/context instead of a terminal command

## Key Dependencies to Leverage

- Angular Material for UI components
- FontAwesome for icons
- CASL for permissions
- PouchDB for offline-first data storage
- Moment.js for date handling
- RxJS for reactive programming
- `@faker-js/faker` for test data generation

Remember: This is a social impact application helping organizations work with beneficiaries. Code quality, accessibility, and reliability are paramount for the mission-critical nature of this software.
