# Welcome!
_Aam Digital_ is open source because we believe in building things together
and letting people benefit from and adapt things rather than everybody reinventing their own wheel.

In order to build great software for small social impact organisations
we rely on anybody willing to contribute.
In fact _Aam Digital_ is completely run by volunteers.
So whether you want to extend our code for your own use case
or just help out - 
we welcome any contributions to make this project better!

    * This walks you through the setup and basic understanding of the project and also gives an overview of the technologies and frameworks involved. 
    * Feel free to skip over steps that seem trivial to you, we tried to make this very beginner friendly.
