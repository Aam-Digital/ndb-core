## Getting started
1. Don't get overwhelmed by the mass of config files in the root directory. Jump directly to the subfolder [src/app/](https://github.com/NGO-DB/ndb-core/tree/master/src/app) where the actually relevant code is located. (If you are completely new to Angular, maybe make yourself familiar with the basic structure and approach first: [Angular - Getting started](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart))
2. The project is structured into several Modules, each in its own folder under src/app/
3. To extend upon the existing system, don't worry about the lower layer modules. Focus on understanding the top level modules adding user features like the `SchoolModule` and the `ChildrenModule`.
