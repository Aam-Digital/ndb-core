# How to add Cypress to project

## Motivation

Up until Angular version 12, Protractor was the default end-to-end testing framework in projects created with Angular CLI. 
Since Angular 12, **[Protractor is deprecated](https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/5502)**.

Cypress is an end-to-end testing framework that is not based on WebDriver. There are no Angular-specific features. Any web site can be tested with Cypress.

Cypress uses the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) libraries for writing tests.

Cypress only supports Firefox as well as Chromium-based browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. It does not support Safari, legacy Edge or even Internet Explorer.

Some information about Cypress:

* [Migrating from Protractor to Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/migrating-to-cypress/protractor)


## Uninstall Protractor
If the protractor is still installed, uninstall it.

1. Run `npm uninstall protractor` this uninstalls a package, completely removing everything npm installed on its behalf.
 It also removes the package from the dependencies, `devDependencies`, `optionalDependencies`, and `peerDependencies` objects in your `package.json`.
 Futher, if you have an `npm-shrinkwrap.json` or `package-lock.json`, npm will update those files as well.
2. Remove `ndb-core/protractor.conf.js` if exists.
3. Remove `ndb-core/e2e` folder if exists and all test inside, if there any.

## Recommended Installation: <br> Installing Cypress using ng 

The following resources may be helpful: 
* [Cypress Angular Schematic](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/npm/cypress-schematic)
* [Getting Started](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/migrating-to-cypress/protractor#Getting-Started)

1. Run `ng add @cypress/schematic`. This will install Cypress, add scripts for running Cypress in run and open mode,
 scaffold base Cypress files and directories.
2. It would ask you **Would you like the default _ng e2e_ command to use Cypress?** Type "Y" to accept.
3. Update `angular.json` in the root folder of the project and find under `"projects":{"cypress-open":{}}` and change to:
```
...
{
...
	"projects": {
		"ndb-core": {
		...
			"lint": {
			...
				"tsConfig": [
				"src/tsconfig.app.json",
				"src/tsconfig.spec.json",
				"e2e/tsconfig.json"
				]
			...
			}
			...
			"cypress-open": {
			  "builder": "@cypress/schematic:cypress",
			  "options": {
				"devServerTarget": "ndb-core:serve",
				"watch": true,
				"headless": false
			  },
			  "configurations": {
				"production": {
				  "devServerTarget": "ndb-core:serve:production"
				}
			  }
			}
		}
		"ndb-core-e2e": {
		...
			"lint": {
				...
				"tsConfig": [
					"e2e/tsconfig.json"
				],
				...
			}
			...
			"cypress-open": {
				"builder": "@cypress/schematic:cypress",
				"options": {
				"devServerTarget": "ndb-core-e2e:serve",
				"watch": true,
				"headless": false
          },
			"configurations": {
				"production": {
					"devServerTarget": "ndb-core-e2e:serve:production"
            }
          }
        }
		}
		...
	}
...
}
...
```
We make it to be able start cypress in `open` mode without serving the app.

4. Next Step is [Configure Cypress in cypress.json]

## Manual Installation: <br> Installing Cypress using npm

The following resource may be helpful: 
* [Installing Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress)
* [Manual Installation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/migrating-to-cypress/protractor#Manual-Installation)


1. Run `npm install --save-dev cypress`. This will install Cypress locally as a dev dependency for your project.
2. Run `npm install --save-dev concurrently` to install [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) to simplify our npm script so that Cypress can work with the application in parallel.
This is optional; however, you will need another way to serve your Angular app for Cypress to run tests against your application.
3. Update `package.json` for your convenience:
```
...
{
	...
	"scripts": {
		...
		"cypress:open": "concurrently \"ng serve\" \"cypress open\"",
		"cypress:run": "concurrently \"ng serve\" \"cypress run\""
		...
	}
	...
}
...
```
4. Run `node_modules\.bin\cypress open` or `npx cypress open`. When we run Cypress for the first time, it generates a bunch of examples that we can learn from, also 
it create a sub-directory named cypress with a scaffold for your tests.
5. Update `angular.json` in the root folder of the project and find under `"projects":{"ndb-core":{"cypress-open":{}}}` and change to:
```
...
{
...
	"projects": {
	...
		"cypress-open": {
          "builder": "@cypress/schematic:cypress",
          "options": {
            "devServerTarget": "ndb-core:serve",
            "watch": true,
            "headless": false
          },
          "configurations": {
            "production": {
              "devServerTarget": "ndb-core:serve:production"
            }
          }
        }
	...
	}
...
}
...
```

## Configure Cypress in cypress.json
The following resource may be helpful: [Configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#cypress-json)

The first time you open Cypress Test Runner, it creates the `cypress.json` configuration file. By default, itâ€™s an empty JSON file.

By default, Cypress keeps everything inside `ndb-core/cypress/` directory. We can rename the folder to `e2e`:
1. Rename `ndb-core/cypress/` to `ndb-core/e2e/` 
2. Update the paths in `cypress.json` file to reflect the new directory structure.
```
{
...
	"downloadsFolder": "e2e/downloads",
	"integrationFolder": "e2e/integration",
	"supportFile": "e2e/support/index.ts",
	"videosFolder": "e2e/videos",
	"screenshotsFolder": "e2e/screenshots",
	"pluginsFile": "e2e/plugins/index.ts",
	"fixturesFolder": "e2e/fixtures"
...
}
```
3. Decide whether Cypress will capture a video of the tests run with cypress `run` mode.
```
{
...
	"video": false
...
}
```
4. We can also [specify different Cypress configuration files per environment](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/migrating-to-cypress/protractor#Specifying-a-custom-cypress-json-config-file)
