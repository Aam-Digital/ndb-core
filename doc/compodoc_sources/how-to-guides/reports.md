# Reports

The reporting module allows organizations to automatically create reports of aggregated data for a given timespan.
This can be used to track indicators and export anonymous data.

There are currently two systems available to generate reports, both using the same config documents (`ReportConfig:*`): 
- SQL-based queries executed server-side using the SQS server
- (legacy) client-side generator using the aggregation & query syntax below

# SQL Reports

For this feature, we have integrated the (optional) [structured-query-service (SQS)](https://neighbourhood.ie/products-and-services/structured-query-server)
(this creates a read-only copy of the data in the CouchDB and allows to run Sqlite queries against it).
SQS enables the possibility to create SQL based queries in reports.

The SQS image is not available as open source and needs a licence. It is pulled from a private container registry.

## Deployment

To activate it for an application, simply activate "aam-backend-service" profile (`COMPOSE_PROFILES=aam-backend-service`) in the applications `.env` file and run `docker compose up -d`.

## Configuration

The reports can be defined as `ReportConfig:*` entities.

There are different modes for `ReportConfig`:

#### Simple SQL Report

```json
// app/ReportConfig:test-report
{
  "_id": "ReportConfig:test-report",
  "title": "Test Report",
  "mode": "sql",
  "aggregationDefinition": "SELECT c.name as name, c.dateOfBirth as dateOfBirth FROM Child c",
  "neededArgs": []
}
```


#### SQL Report With Arguments
Additional arguments for the query (like a from and to date parameter) can be used in the SQL query directly using "?". The "neededArgs" array defines what arguments are filled for the "?" placeholders in the given order.

```json
// app/ReportConfig:test-report
{
  "_id": "ReportConfig:test-report",
  "title": "Test Report",
  "mode": "sql",
  "aggregationDefinition": "SELECT c.name as name, c.dateOfBirth as dateOfBirth FROM Child c WHERE created_at BETWEEN ? AND ?",
  "neededArgs": [
    "from",
    "to"
  ]
}
```

# JSON-Query Reports (legacy)

#### Aggregation structure

Inside the `aggregationDefinitions` an array of aggregations can be added.
The following example shows the structure of an aggregation.

```json
{
  "label": "Events",
  "query": "EventNote:toArray[*date >= ? & date <= ?]",
  "groupBy": ["category"],
  "aggregations": [
    {
      "query": ":getParticipantsWithAttendance(PRESENT):unique:addPrefix(Child):toEntities",
      "groupBy": ["gender", "religion"],
      "label": "Participants"
    }
  ]
}
```

- The `label` will be used to display the length of the `query` result in the final report.
- The `query` defines a valid [JSON-Query](https://github.com/auditassistant/json-query#queries).
- `groupBy` defines an array of properties by which the results of the `query` are grouped,
  these results will be nested in the top-level query.
- The `aggregations` array can be filled with further aggregations with the same structure.
  They will be executed on the result of the `query` as well as on each `groupBy` result.

#### `query` syntax

A full documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/auditassistant/json-query#queries).
The most top-level aggregation has to start with the entity which should be queried.
This can be done by selecting the entity type and chaining it with `:toArray`: e.g. `Child:toArray`.
Now the array of all children is ready to be aggregated.
You could for example be interested in all the children older than 10: `Child:toArray[* age > 10]`.
The `*` tells the query language to select all the children and not just one.
The simple `age` call refers to the `get age()` function of the child entity.
If you are interested in all female children older than 10 the call would look like `Child:toArray[* age>10 & gender=F]`.
If you are only interested in the names of these children `Child:toArray[* age>10 & gender=M].name` will transform the
array of children into an array of strings.

To navigate between different entities a set of functions extends the query syntax.
The full documentation for all the available functions can be found and extended in the
[QueryService](../../injectables/QueryService.html).
The first function you already know `:toArray` which creates an object into an array of values of this object.
The following functions also exist:

- `:unique` removes all duplicates from an array
- `:addPrefix(<ENTITY_TYPE>)` adds the prefix `<ENTITY_TYPE>` to all strings in the input array.
  This is necessary to use the `:toEntities` function.
  The prefix will only be added if it is not set yet.
- `:toEntities` transforms an array of entity-ids into an array of entities.
  The IDs need to have the full format e.g. `Child:1234-5678`.
  Therefore `:addPrefix` should always be used to add the correct entity before calling `:toEntities`.
- `:getRelated(<ENTITY_TYPE>, <PROPERTY_NAME>)` is used to get the entity or entities which are mentioned through ids
  on a property of another entity e.g., to get all children that are part of a set of notes write `Note:toArray:getRelated(Child, children)`
- `:getIds(<PROPERTY_NAME>)` works similar to `:getRelated` but does not transform the ids into entities.
- `:filterByObjectAttribute(<PROPERTY_NAME>, <KEY>, <VALUE>)` is used to filter by an attribute which is a complex
  object like a `configurable-enum`. `<PROPERTY_NAME>` refers to the name of the property of the parent attribute,
  `<KEY>` refers to a key of this property and `<VALUE>` refers to the value(s) for which should be filtered.
  `<VALUE>` can be a string of multiple matches which are separated by `|`.
  E.g., to get all notes which are home visits or guardian talks write:
  `Note:toArray:filterByObjectAttribute(category, id, HOME_VISIT|GUARDIAN_TALK)`
- `:getParticipantsWithAttendance(<ATTENDANCE_STATUS>)` only returns the children with the given attendance for a set
  of notes. The attendance refers to the `:countAs` attribute. To get all present children write
  `Note:toArray:getParticipantsWithAttendance(PRESENT)`
- `:addEntities(<ENTITY_TYPE>)` can be used to create an array holding multiple entity types.
  E.g., to create an array holding notes and event notes write `Note:toArray:addEntities(EventNote)`.
