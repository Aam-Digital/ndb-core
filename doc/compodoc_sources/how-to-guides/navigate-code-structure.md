# How to navigate the code structure
The application code is split within the `src/app/` directory into modules providing
general features and abstract components (_core_) and
concrete feature modules for projects' use cases (_child-dev-project_).

Overall the following guidelines apply:
* Different functionalities are usually split into separate Angular Modules each in its own folder.
* At least all core features are well documented with JsDoc comments
and therefore also have a complete API Reference here (see [Modules](/modules.html)).
* If you have a certain challenge, browse the "How-To Guides" here in the documentation
reusable features and approaches are documented there.
