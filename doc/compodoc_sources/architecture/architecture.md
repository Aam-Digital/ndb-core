An actual, specific software system to be used will be based on the core and extend it:

## EntitySchema System
see [Entity Schema System](./architecture/entity-schema.html)

## Folder Structure
The application code is split within the `src/app/` directory into modules providing
general features and abstract components (_core_) and
concrete feature modules for users' use cases (currently only _child-dev-project_).
