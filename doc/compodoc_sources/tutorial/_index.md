# Tutorial: First Steps

> This Tutorial is still work in progress and will be further extended & improved.

In this tutorial we will walk you through the first steps of getting the _Aam Digital_ project up and running -
and writing your first little extension to it.

We will focus on things specific to our project.
But there will be links to other tutorials and resources about the basics of the technologies we use.

If anything is unclear or missing, _please_ open an issue on GitHub.
Your questions and feedback are very welcome!
