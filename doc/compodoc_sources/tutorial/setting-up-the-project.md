# Tutorial: Setting up the Project

In order to work on our project you should first set up a local development environment.
That way you can run the app on your own computer and immediately see and test changes you make.

## Setup

We have documented the steps to clone and set up the project in our [README in the "Development" section](https://github.com/Aam-Digital/ndb-core#development)

## Run

Did you follow the steps in the README and have been able to successfully execute `npm start`?

Visit your local app in a browser at http://localhost:4200/

If you can see and use Aam Digital there, you are good to go. Great!
