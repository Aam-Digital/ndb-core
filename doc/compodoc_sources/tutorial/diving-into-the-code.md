# Tutorial: Diving into the Code
> TODO: this needs a more detailed explanation of the most basic aspects of the code base

## Getting started with coding
1. Don't get overwhelmed by the mass of config files in the root directory.
 Jump directly to the subfolder `src/app/` where the actually relevant code is located.
2. The project is structured into several Modules, each in its own folder under src/app/core (general features) or src/app/child-ded-project (special user-facing features)
3. To extend upon the existing system, don't worry about the lower layer modules.
 Focus on understanding the top level modules adding user features like the `SchoolModule` and the `ChildrenModule`.
