# Tutorial: Using Aam Digital (as a user)

Before changing things or implementing new features, you should get a basic idea of how Aam Digital currently works for our users.
Feel free to reach out to someone from our team, if you haven't already. We'll be happy to give you a demo and talk about the needs and backgrounds of our users.

To get a true feeling for the app, work through the following short usage scenarios yourself:

## Basic participants & notes

1. Register a new participant in the system. (Hint: Go through the "Children" list)
2. Add a note about your new participant. (Hint: Either expand the "Notes & Reports" section or use the blue "primary action" button on the bottom right)
3. Find your new note in the project-wide list of notes. (Hint: Navigate to the "Notes" list using the main menu on the left)

## Recording attendance

1. Add your new participant to a "Recurring Activity". (Hint: open the details of one activity from the "Recurring Activities" list and add the name in the "Participants" section)
2. Record today's attendance for that activity. (Hint: Use "Record Attendance" and find the activity you have just added your participant to)
3. See your participant's attendance record. (Hint: Open the details view for your participant by clicking on the relevant row in the "Children" list and then expand the "Attendance" section)
