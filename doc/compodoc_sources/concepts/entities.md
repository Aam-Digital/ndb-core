# Entities & Entity Schema

---

For us, an "Entity" is an object in the database (and a representation of something in the user's real world, e.g. a "Child" or "School").
Entities are at the core of the Aam Digital platform and the primary way to customize the system is to adapt and add new entity types.

The Entity Schema defines the data structure as well as how it is displayed in the UI.
Entity instances also have some generic functionality inherited from the `Entity` base class.
