# Documentation Structure

Our documentation is structured into four different approaches,
following the concept laid out at **www.divio.com/blog/documentation**:

1. TUTORIALS
   - learning-oriented
   - allow the newcomer to get started
   - are lessons
   - _Analogy: teaching a small child how to cook_
2. HOW-TO GUIDES
   - goal-oriented
   - show how to solve a specific problem
   - are a series of steps
   - _Analogy: a recipe in a cookery book_
3. CONCEPTS
   - understanding-oriented
   - explain
   - provide background and context
   - _Analogy: an article on culinary social history_
4. REFERENCE
   - information-oriented
   - describe the machinery
   - accurate and complete
   - _Analogy: a reference encyclopaedia article_

A good reference and repository of documentation templates also is
[The Good Docs Project](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/).
