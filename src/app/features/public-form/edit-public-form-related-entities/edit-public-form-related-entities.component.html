  <h2 i18n>Collect replies of this form linked to individual records</h2>
  <p i18n>
    You can use forms with a special “magic link” to collect responses from
    participants that are already registered in your system. By sending out an
    individual link to each person, the form response(s) from that person can be
    linked into their profile. For example, you can collect feedback or an
    evaluation survey and relate each submission to the specific participant or
    organisation that gave it.
