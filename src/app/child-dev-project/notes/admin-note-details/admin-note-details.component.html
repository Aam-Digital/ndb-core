  You can edit how users will see the Note details of a single record. Drag and
  drop fields and sections in this preview of a profile view and group them as
  appropriate. The editor below closely resembles how the form will look for
  users later.
  <br />
  We recommend to keep things simple: Only add fields that you really need for
  your work.
