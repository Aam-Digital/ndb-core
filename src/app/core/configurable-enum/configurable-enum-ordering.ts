/**
 * Support for types of configurable enums that impose a total ordering of their elements.
 * Not all configurable enums (should sensibly) be able to be ordered. For example, it does
 * not make sense to see which school / center is "greater than" another center, or which gender is above
 * which other gender.
 *
 * For other enum types it is, however, sensible to impose a total ordering such as warning levels ('OK' is
 * somewhat 'better' than 'WARNING').
 *
 * Configurable enum values that impose a total ordering can be compared, which also means that they can be sorted,
 * and thus have a notion of one element being 'greater than' or 'less than' to another element. The interpretation
 * of 'greater' or 'less' than is dependent on the concrete enum.
