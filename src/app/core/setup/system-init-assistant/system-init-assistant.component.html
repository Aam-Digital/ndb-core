      Aam Digital is very flexible and can be quickly adapted to your needs and
      data structures. It is not limited to the scenarios above. After
      initializing your system, you can further customize it to track, measure,
      and manage your project.

      We have loaded some sample data into this demo system. Explore and play
      around – you can’t break anything!<br />
      Changes you make in this demo will <em>not</em> be saved anywhere. The
      system is reset after you close or reload the page.

      You can get assistance by clicking the "Assistant" button on the top right
      of the toolbar. From there you can also switch to other demo scenarios.
