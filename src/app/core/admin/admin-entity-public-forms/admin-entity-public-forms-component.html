  You can share the link to a "Public Form" with people who do not have an
  account or embed it in your website. People can submit new records through
  this form without logging in. For example, you can let participants
  self-register this way and then review their data later.

<div>
  <app-related-entities
    entityType="PublicFormConfig"
    property="entity"
    [columns]="['title', 'route', 'description']"
    [entity]="dummyEntity"

</div>

  You can also create forms for <strong>"related records"</strong> (e.g. a
  survey that links back to the participant's record who has submitted the
  form). For this, create a form for the "related record's type" (e.g. the
  survey entity) and enable the setting to create custom, individualized form
  links there.
